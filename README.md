<h1>PDFSurgeon</h1>
<h2>.NET Windows Forms project allowing you to view and manipulate the content of PDF documents.</h2>
<p>As well as an example project, this is also a utility. You have the source so it is easy to adapt to your needs, however for most requirements it should be fine as-is.</p>
<p>You can open a PDF and see the individual objects within it. It has a search function so you can search for all objects matching a particular structure or perhaps referencing another specific object. You can edit objects and then resave the document.</p>
<p>You can even decompress and edit a content stream for a particular page and see the changes to the rendered appearance in real time. As you type into the content stream, the rendered page changes.</p>
<p>For getting to know how PDF documents and content streams work, this is an invaluable tool.</p>
<p>In the screenshot below you can see how the structure of a PDF is displayed.</p>
